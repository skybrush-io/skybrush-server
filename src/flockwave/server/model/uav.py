        and similar methods in this class.

        The primary purpose of this function is to handle the most common case
        when a single operation has to be performed for a list of UAVs. The
        function assumes that there is a dedicated _handler_ function (either
        sync or async) that can perform the operation for a _single_ UAV, and
        optionally another, _broadcaster_ function that can perform the operation
        by broadcasting a message to all affected UAVs. The results from the
        individual handlers are then merged into a dictionary consisting of
        results (for UAVs with sync handlers) and awaitables (for UAVs with
        async handlers).

        Arguments:
            uavs: the list of UAVs to dispatch the request to
            request_name: name of the request (operation) for logging purposes,
                also to be used in error messages
            handler: the handler function that can perform the operation for a
                single UAV
            broadcaster: the broadcaster function that can perform the operation
                by broadcasting a message

        Returns:
