class MessageHub:
    """Central entity in a Flockwave server that handles incoming messages
    and prepares outbound messages for dispatch.

    Users of this class can register message handlers that will be invoked
    for incoming messages based on the type of the incoming message using
    the `register_message_handler()`_ method. The method allows one to
    register specific handlers for one or more message types as well as
    generic message handlers that are invoked for all messages. Specific
    handlers are always invoked before generic ones; otherwise the handlers
    are called in the order they were registered.

    Message handler functions are required to return one of the following
    values:

    - ``False`` or ``None`` if they decided not to handle the message they
      were given.

    - ``True`` to indicate that they have handled the message and no further
      action is needed

    - A ``dict`` that contains a response body that should be sent back to
      the caller. In this case, the hub will wrap the body in an appropriate
      message envelope that refers to the ID of the message that the
      object responds to.

    - A FlockwaveResponse_ object that is *already* constructed in a way
      that it responds to the original message.

    When the body of the response returned from the handler does not contain
    a message type (i.e. a ``type`` key), it will be added automatically,
    assuming that it is equal to the type of the incoming message.

    This object holds a reference to a dispatcher function that can be used to
    send messages from the message hub of the application. It also holds a
    mapping from _message group names_ to _rate limiters_.

    There are two operations that you can do with this helper object: you
    can either register a new message group name with a corresponding rate
    limiter, or send a request to one of the registered rate limiters, given
    the corresponding message group name. The request contains additional
    positional and keyword arguments that are interpreted by the rate limiter
    and that the rate limiter uses to decide whether to send a message, and if
    so, _when_ to send it.

    For instance, a default rate limiter registered to UAV-INF messages may
    check whether an UAV-INF message has been sent recently, and if so, it
    may wait up to a given number of milliseconds before it sends another
    UAV-INF message, collecting UAV IDs in a temporary variable while it is
    waiting for the next opportunity to send a message. Another rate limiter
    registered to CONN-INF messages may check the new state of a connection,
    and if the new state is a "transitioning" state, it may wait a short
    period of time before sending a message to see whether the transition
    settles or not.

    Rate limiters must satisfy the RateLimiter_ interface. A UAVMessageRateLimiter_
    is provided for the most common use-case where UAV IDs are collected and
    sent in a single batch with a minimum prescribed delay between batches.
