        This function throws an error if the ID is already taken.

        Arguments:
            channel_id (str): the ID of the communication channel type
            factory (callable): a callable that constructs a new
                communication channel of this type when invoked with no
                arguments. The callable is typically a class that extends
                CommunicationChannel_ and has an appropriate constructor,
                but can be an arbitrary callable as long as it returns an
                instance of CommunicationChannel_.
            address (Optional[callable]): a callable that can be called with
                a single host-port pair or ``None`` and that returns a tuple
                consisting of a hostname and the corresponding port where the
                communication channel can be accessed from the outside. The
                callable may be ``None`` or may return ``None`` if such a
                location cannot sensibly be derived. The argument of the
                callable describes the remote address that is interested in
                the location of the channel; the implementation should strive
                to return an IP address that is on the same subnet as the remote
                address.
            broadcaster (Optional[callable]): a callable that implements
                broadcasting a message to all clients who are currently
                connected to the server with this communication channel
                type. The callable will be called with the message to be
                sent as its only argument. When this property is ``None``,
                it is assumed that there is no compact way to broadcast
                a message to all the clients who are connected with this
                channel type, and the application will fall back to sending
                individual messages.
            ssdp_location (Optional[callable]): a callable that can be called
                with a single host-port pair or ``None`` and that returns a
                URI describing the location where the communication channel
                can be accessed from the outside. For instance, a TCP channel
                may return ``tcp://192.168.1.17:1234`` there if the server is
                listening on 192.168.1.17, port 1234. The callable may be
                ``None`` or may return ``None`` if such a location cannot
                sensibly be derived. The argument of the callable describes the
                remote address that is interested in the location of the
                channel; the implementation should strive to return an IP
                address that is on the same subnet as the remote address.
